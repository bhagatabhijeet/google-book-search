    title: 'The Vile Village',
    author: 'Daniel Handler',
    description: "The Vile Village is the seventh novel in the children's book series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket (the pen name of American author Daniel Handler), which consists of 13 children's novels that follow the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents' death. The children are placed in the custody of their distant cousin/uncle Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance. After the Baudelaires are removed from his care by their parents' estate executor, Mr. Poe, Olaf begins to doggedly hunt the children down, bringing about the serial slaughter and demise of a multitude of characters. In The Vile Village, the Baudelaire orphans are taken into the care of a whole village, only to find many rules and chores, evil seniors, as well as Count Olaf and his evil girlfriend lurking nearby. This book marks a turning point in the structure of the series and effectively marks the halfway mark between books one to six and eight to thirteen. It breaks with the following major patterns of the earlier books in the series: The Baudelaires can no longer call on Mr. Poe for assistance after the events of this book, although he was barely any help to begin with. The Baudelaires themselves are deemed criminals, and they are not assigned any more legal guardians after this point. As a result, because the authorities turn their attention away from him and to the Baudelaires, Count Olaf no longer needs to bother with disguises (apart from a voice-only disguise in The Hostile Hospital and one final disguise in The End which, for the only time in the series, fools no one).",
